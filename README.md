# Solar Cell PV Yield (kWh) Predictions
## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the solar cell PV yield (kWh) based on various environmental factors and solar characteristics. Using AI techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy of energy yield predictions to optimize solar energy harvesting.

## Dataset Includes:
 - Number of solar panels
 - Wattage each solar panel can produce
 - Average Temperature (℉)
 - Average Humidity
 - Average Wind Speed
 - Average Pressure
 - Hours between sunrise & sunset
 - Weather Predictions with a ±20% variation

## AI Techniques Used:
**- K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm**
**- Random Forest Regressor**
**- Gradient Boosting Regressor**

## Model Evaluation:
To evaluate the performance of the models, we use **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** as the primary weighting criterion to compare predictions against actual values.
